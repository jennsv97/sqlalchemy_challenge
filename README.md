# sqlalchemy_challenge
My challenges I expericened working on the sqlalchemy was ensuring the proper setup of Flask API and SQLAlchemy to correctly fetch and display data, along with resolving issues related to missing Python dependencies. Throughout the process, I used Learning assiant to troubleshoot code errors, clarify how to structure API endpoints, and get guidance on using the necessary libraries for database queries. I experience most of my troubles while working the Flask API portion of the assignment since when I would run my app.py on my terminal I would not get anything in my output and had to install missing imports so I see my HTML and see my progress.
